Title: Binary Search Tree Implementation (1/30/23-2/24/23)
This is my personal data structure assignement for my high school advanced Java class.  In this assignment, I was tasked with choosing a linear search data structure to implement, but I chose to research binary search trees instead.  This proved to be more difficult, as I had to learn how to traverse the interwoven nodes of binary search trees, rather than reading the top of bottom of stacks/queues.  I used the resources below to learn about this data structure.  This assignment required that I add, remove, and traverse through the elements, as well as outputting data within the tree.  I also had to use getters and setters to store data and output values.
